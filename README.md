# myRetail-REST-demo
Demo app showcasing REST microservice architecture

## Overview

**Objective:**

Demonstrate the creation of a restful products API (for a simulated retail company with 200+ locations) which will aggregate product data from multiple sources and return it as JSON to the caller. The goal is to create a RESTful service that can retrieve product and price details by ID. 

**Requirements:**
1. Create a logical URL structure for HTTP calls.
2. Create one HTTP GET request at URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) "/products/{id}" which delivers product data as a JSON response (where {id} will be assumed to be a number)
3. Performs an HTTP GET request inside the HTTP GET request defined in requiremnet 2 that retrieves the product name from an API
4. Reads the pricing information from a NoSQL data store and combines it with the JSON product id and name from the HTTP requests in requirement 2 and 3 to return price in the response of requirment 2.
5. Accepts an HTTP PUT request at the same URI path from requirement 2, containing a JSON request body similar to the GET response, and updates the productâ€™s price in the data store.
6. API can talk to multiple client devices; examples include: shared domain/network web apps,  mobile apps, etc. 

## Design

**General:**

Looking through the requirements, it can be interpreted that three separate services exist to manage information if we are to follow microservice architecture: products (requirement 2), product_detail (Requirement 3), and product_pricing (Requirement 4). The products service is the only service to communicate with client apps, while the other two services are to be considered "backend" or "company use" only. Also, an assumption will be made that suggests that all three services sit under the same domain and that Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is not an issue between the three services. For this design, product_detail will be a simulated service with a JSON format already in place and no programming being done to alter formats of the response structure (as if to simulate an already in service API used by the retail business); JSON formatting may be done once the response from product_detail reaches the product API. Based on requirement 6 and the initial objective, an API gateway/proxy could be used to simplify routing to the products API and to handle possible future scaling/throttling.

**Implementation:**

For the implementation of this design I have decided to use the C# programming language with the .NET 5.0 SDK(https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) and ASP.Net/web development package (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/workload-component-id-vs-professional?view=vs-2019#aspnet-and-web-development). The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used to compile and locally run the code was Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019 Version 16.11.3 running on a desktop machine with the operating system (x64) Windows 10 Pro OS build 19043.1237.


THE .NET 5.0 SDK is free, open source, and cross-platform. When utilizing the web development package and creating a WEB API solution, a Program.cs file and a Startup.cs file are created. The Program.cs file contains the Main(string[] args) function (which signifies the first element ran when starting the solution). Inside the Main() function, a call to the function CreateHostBuilder is performed such that a web host is being created with the parameters contained within the Startup.cs.


    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            CreateHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();
        }

        public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
            Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
                .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
                {
                    webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>();
                });
    }
    
Beside the general C# setup files that handle the large task of starting the web service, creating a WEB API solution with .NET relies on the model/controller structure. A model class/.cs file contains the majority of the "backend" work (i.e. JSON manipulation, file reads/writes, etc.) while the controller may call functions contained within the model it also holds the important task of "controlling" where/how HTTP commands are accepted by way of tags above the functions it creates.

Example model:

    public class products
    {
        //This is a constructor for the products class
        //It has no parameters
        public products()
        {

        }


    }
    
Example controller:

    public class ProductsController : Controller
    {
        [HttpGet()]
        [Route("api/[controller]/{id}")]
        public void GetProduct(long id)
        {
            
        }
    }

**Code Design:**

Two independent web APIs were created for this assignment: Product and ProductPricing. 

The Product Web API consists of 3 model classes: a generic HTTP caller for GET/POST/PUT/etc. functions, a generic JSON parse class to handle the irregular/unknow JSON formats from the incoming ProductDetail API, and a Products class for storage of items that will be JSON output. There is one controller object in the Product Web API that has one asynchronus function called GetProduct (URI routing api/Products/{id}); this is where many of the code calls happen.

The ProductPricing Web API consists of two model classes (LiteDB & Price) and one controller(ProductPriceController). LiteDB was the NOSQL storage solution choice (NuGet Install-Package LiteDB) for the productpricing portion of this assignment. The functions contained within the LiteDB model can fill a nosql file (.db) based on the Price class: see function FillDB and the subsequent call in the startup file of the ProductPricing API. the ProductPriceController has one function that performs a GET to retrieve product price alon the URI path api/ProductPrice/{itemID}/{storeID}.

## Set-Up

1. Download and open the zipped version from main or the file version from master. 
2. Click the solution file (.sln) and open in Visual Studio.
3. Right click the solution in Solution Explorer and go to properties.
4. Select Startup Project on the left under Common Properties.
5. Select the Multiple startup projects button and make sure the action dropdown under Product and ProductPricing is set to 'Start'
6. Hit Apply and then OK in the bottom right corner.
7. Open the Startup.cs file and edit in a line(s) for DB creation (example:lDB.FillDB("test", 1, 2, 7.77);) in the Configure function
8. Click the 'Start' button in Visual Studio to launch both Web APIs: Product and ProductPricing.
9. Notice also that a Swagger web page launches which will allow input for controller calls and execution using CURL* (see below).

## Testing

**Ad-Hoc:**

Ad-Hoc testing was performed using Swagger CURL (https://curl.se/) commands and a client tool called Postman (https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

**Unit Testing:**

Unit Testing projects were created and started under each of the individual web APIs: ProductPricingTests & ProductTests

## Future Changes

**Security:**

As discussed in the initial requirments an API gateway or proxy could be used to intercept communication and route commands to various servers and/or multiple instances of the APIs. Authentication is another form of security that could be addressed in the future. Even if certain APIs are business facing, safeguards in place to prevent overuse or unauthorized use even from internal clients should exist.

**Hosting:**

The Web APIs have the ability to be hosted in multiple environments: Localized servers running IIS webhosting software, Azure cloud instanced versions of the app can be pushed directly from the IDE, or even linux based hosting is available.

**Code Cleanup:**

Being that this was a sample app to showcase Microservices/REST, some direct hardcoded values were used in an effort to showcase end results.
